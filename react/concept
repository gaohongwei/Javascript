##### Babel #####
Babel is a JavaScript compiler
Write next generation JavaScript,
(a) => {a}    (function(a){a;});
(a) => (a)    (function(a){ return a;});

let a=0;  var a=0;


##### jsx #####
JSX is a preprocessor step that 
adds XML syntax to JavaScript. 
You can definitely use React without JSX but JSX makes React a lot more elegant. 
Just like XML, JSX tags have a tag name, attributes, and children.
