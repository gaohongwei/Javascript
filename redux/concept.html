Actions 
  tells what happend
  payloads (data, or information) 
  your application -> your store(reducer)
  Sample:
  {
    type: ADD_TODO,
    text: 'Build my first Redux app'
  }
Action Creators
  functions that create actions.
  function addTodo(text) {
    return {
      type: ADD_TODO,
      text
    }
  }
Reducers 
  update the application's state according to actions
  don't mutate the state
  return a new state with Object.assign({}, state, {})

Store
  the object that brings actions/reducer together
  Holds application state;
  Allows access to state via getState();
  Allows state to be updated via dispatch(action);
  Registers listeners via subscribe(listener);
  Handles unregistering of listeners via the function returned by subscribe(listener).

  only one store in a Redux application. 
  When you want to split your data handling logic, you'll use reducer composition instead of many stores.
