Angular templates are dynamic. 
When Angular renders them, it transforms the DOM according to the instructions given by directives.

A directive is a class with directive metadata. 
In TypeScript we apply the @Directive decorator to attach metadata to the class.

We already met one form of directive: the component. 
A component is a directive-with-a-template; 
a @Component decorator is actually a @Directive decorator extended with template-oriented features.

While a component is technically a directive, components are so distinctive and 
central to Angular applications that we chose to separate components from directives in this architectural overview.
