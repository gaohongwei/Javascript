The Angular module — a class decorated with @NgModule — 
is a fundamental feature of Angular itself.

JavaScript also has its own module system for managing collections of JavaScript objects. 

In JavaScript each file is a module and all objects defined in the file belong to that module. 
The module declares some objects to be public by marking them with the export key word. 
Other JavaScript modules use import statements to access public objects from other modules.
