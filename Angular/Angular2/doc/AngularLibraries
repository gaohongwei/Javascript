Angular itself ships as a collection of JavaScript modules. We can think of them as library modules.

Each Angular library name begin with the @angular prefix.

Install them with the npm package manager and 
Import parts of them with JavaScript import statements.

Import Angular's Component decorator from the @angular/core library like this:
Import Angular modules from Angular libraries using JavaScript import statements:
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';

Our application module needs material from within that BrowserModule so 
we add it to the @NgModule metadata imports like this.

imports:      [ BrowserModule ],
We're using both the Angular and JavaScript module systems together.

It's easy to confuse the two systems because they share the common vocabulary of "imports" and "exports".
